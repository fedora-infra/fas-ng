FAS2 / Noggin FAQ
=================

Noggin was developed initally as a replacement for the Fedora Account System version 2 (FAS2).
There are a handful of differences that long-time users of FAS will notice when migrating to 
Noggin from FAS.


Group Admininstrators / Sponsors
================================
In FAS, groups had *Admininstrators* that had the abiliy to add new members and new Admininstrators to a group.
In Noggin, groups have *Sponsors* which have the abilty to add new members to a group. In Noggin, new Sponsors are
managed by System Admininstrators.

.. note:: In the Fedora Noggin deployment, this is achieved by filing a ticket at https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/new_issue


Requesting to Join a Group
===========================
In FAS, a user could request access to a group, which a group admininstrator could either approve or deny.
In Noggin, users are simply just added to the group by a sponsor after requesting access through other channels for that
group, such as email or IRC.
